## üîç Overview

The Secrets Detector scans GitHub repositories for committed secrets, certificates, and API tokens. When detected, these items are validated to determine if they are legitimate secrets or test/dummy data. Real secrets can be blocked from being committed, protecting your organization from accidental credential leaks.

### Key Features

- **Automated Secret Detection**: Scans repository content for various types of sensitive information
- **Validation Engine**: Distinguishes between real secrets and test/dummy data
- **GitHub Integration**: Works as a GitHub App to process repository events
- **Push Protection**: Can block commits containing real secrets
- **Visualization**: Includes Grafana dashboards for monitoring and reporting
- **GitHub Advanced Security Integration**: Compatible with GitHub's security features

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of several key components:

1. **GitHub App** - A service that receives webhook events from GitHub, processes the repository content, and detects potential secrets. Written in Go, it communicates with GitHub's API and your repositories.

2. **Validation Service** - A separate service that validates detected secrets to determine if they are legitimate issues or test/dummy data. It employs various validation techniques for different types of secrets.

3. **Database** - A PostgreSQL database stores detection results, repository information, and validation history.

4. **Grafana Dashboard** - Visualization and monitoring of detection metrics and repository risk.

The components communicate securely using mutual TLS authentication and API keys for service-to-service communication.

## üìã Prerequisites

For local development:
  - Go 1.23+
  - Docker and Docker Compose
  - Git
  - OpenSSL (for certificate generation)

## üöÄ Installation

### Docker Compose Deployment

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/secrets-detector.git
cd secrets-detector
```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file with your GitHub App credentials and other configuration
```

3. **Generate TLS certificates** (for secure service communication):
```bash
./test-tls-cert-creation.sh
```

4. **Start the services**:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. **Update your GitHub App webhook URL** to point to your Docker host: `http://your-server:3000/webhook`

6. **Access the Grafana dashboard** at `http://localhost:3001` (default credentials: admin/admin)

### Setting Up Your .env File

The `.env` file contains all the configuration settings for the application. Here's a detailed guide to set it up properly:

1. **Copy the example file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **GitHub Authentication**: You must configure at least one of these authentication methods:
   ```
   # Option 1: Personal Access Token (simplest method)
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   
   # Option 2: GitHub App Authentication
   GITHUB_APP_ID=12345
   GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID=67890
   ```
   - For GitHub App authentication, you'll also need to place your private key in `./keys/github.pem`

3. **GitHub Enterprise Configuration** (optional):
   ```
   # Only needed for GitHub Enterprise
   GITHUB_BASE_URL=https://github.yourcompany.com/api/v3/
   ```

4. **Scanner Configuration**:
   ```
   SCANNER_CONCURRENCY=5         # Number of parallel scanning operations
   SCANNER_BATCH_SIZE=10         # Commits to process in a batch
   SCANNER_MAX_DEPTH=1000        # Maximum commit history depth 
   SCANNER_SCAN_PRIVATE=true     # Whether to scan private repositories
   SCANNER_RATE_LIMIT=5000       # GitHub API rate limit to respect
   SCANNER_PAUSE_TIME=60         # Pause time in seconds when rate limited
   ```

5. **Repository Filtering**:
   ```
   EXCLUDE_REPOS=archived-repo,test-repo  # Comma-separated list of repos to ignore
   EXCLUDE_ORGS=third-party-org           # Comma-separated list of orgs to ignore
   ```

6. **Debug Mode**:
   ```
   DEBUG_MODE=false              # Enable for verbose logging
   ```

7. **Security Settings**:
   ```
   # TLS Configuration
   TLS_ENABLED=true              # Enable TLS for validation service
   MTLS_ENABLED=true             # Enable mutual TLS for service-to-service auth
   
   # Blocking behavior
   BLOCK_COMMITS=true            # Whether to block commits with real secrets
   ```

8. **API Keys and Secrets**:
   ```
   # Used for service-to-service authentication
   VALIDATION_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here
   
   # For GitHub webhook verification
   GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-here
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### GitHub App Setup

1. **Create a GitHub App** in your organization:
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí GitHub Apps ‚Üí New GitHub App
   - Set the name, homepage URL, and webhook URL
   - Set permissions:
     - Repository contents: Read
     - Metadata: Read
     - Pull requests: Read
   - Subscribe to events: Push, Pull request
   - Generate and download a private key

2. **Install the app** to your organization or specific repositories

3. **Configure the webhook URL** to point to your Docker host: `http://your-server:3000/webhook`

### Environment Variables

The application can be configured using environment variables (see the .env file setup section above). Key variables include:

**GitHub App:**
- `GITHUB_APP_ID` - The ID of your GitHub App
- `GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID` - The installation ID of your GitHub App
- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Secret used to validate webhook payloads
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Alternative to GitHub App for simpler setup
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (debug, info, warn, error)
- `FULL_FILE_ANALYSIS` - Analyze full files rather than just diffs (true/false)
- `BLOCK_COMMITS` - Whether to block commits containing secrets (true/false)

**Validation Service:**
- `TLS_ENABLED` - Enable TLS (true/false)
- `MTLS_ENABLED` - Enable mutual TLS (true/false)
- `API_KEY` - API key for service-to-service authentication

**Database:**
- `DB_HOST` - Database host (default: postgres)
- `DB_PORT` - Database port (default: 5432)
- `DB_USER` - Database username (default: secretsuser)
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password (default: secretspass)
- `DB_NAME` - Database name (default: secretsdb)

### Secrets Management

Your `.env` file should never be committed to version control. Here are best practices for managing secrets:

1. **Use .gitignore**: Ensure `.env` is included in your `.gitignore` file
2. **Use environment variables**: For production, prefer environment variables instead of .env files
3. **Rotate secrets regularly**: Change your GitHub webhook secrets and API keys periodically

## üîí Security

### TLS Configuration

The application supports TLS and mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication between services:

1. **Generate certificates** for development:
   ```bash
   ./test-tls-cert-creation.sh
   ```

2. **Configure TLS** in your .env file:
   ```
   TLS_ENABLED=true
   TLS_CERT_FILE=/app/certs/server.crt
   TLS_KEY_FILE=/app/certs/server.key
   ```

3. **Enable mutual TLS** for service-to-service authentication:
   ```
   MTLS_ENABLED=true
   CA_CERT_FILE=/app/certs/ca.crt
   ```

### Secure Service Communication

The services communicate securely using:

1. **mTLS** - Both services authenticate each other using certificates
2. **API Key Authentication** - The GitHub App must provide a valid API key when calling the Validation Service
3. **Secure HTTP Headers** - Only specific HTTP headers are allowed

### Secrets Storage

Sensitive information is handled securely:

1. **GitHub App Private Keys** - Stored in `./keys/github.pem` (never commit to version control)
2. **Database Credentials** - Stored in .env file (never commit to version control)
3. **Webhook Secrets** - Used to validate incoming webhooks from GitHub
